# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 19.5 / 21 | Overall, highly intuitive, clear directions, well designed, easy to use. Feed can be somewhat distracting from other tasks. |
| Handshake | 19.0 / 21 | Overall, highly intuitive, clear directions. Some places to improve in design. Easy to use, specifically designed for college students' job searches. |

## 2.2 Site 1 - LinkedIn (preferred)
Job Search Process with Screenshots & Steps:

*Note - I already have an account on this site and will be proceeding with the following steps under that assumption.

#### Step 1 - Go To LinkedIn Home Page
![LinkedIn Home Page - Login Screen](/assets/linkedin_login.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/

The home page displays the sign-in and account creation options prominently and clearly. It is intuitive and directs the user toward a specific action.

I like how the user does not need to search for the login or account creation buttons - all of these options are clear and intuitive. The screen is not crowded with unnecessary words.

#### Step 2 - After Logging In
![LinkedIn Feed](/assets/linkedin_after_login.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/?trk=homepage-basic_sign-in-submit

LinkedIn brings up a feed immediately after the user logs in. It encourages the user to scroll through that feed, but also has a clear menu at the top to navigate to other portions of the site - for instance, viewing your network, searching for jobs, or messaging other users.

I like that LinkedIn offers the user multiple options - since there are many ways to use the site - after logging in. However, I would change the default landing page. Scrolling through this feed is rarely useful, while job searching and growing your network are. This page is fairly busy and might sidetrack users who want to accomplish a specific task.

#### Step 3 - Jobs Home Page
![LinkedIn Jobs Home Page - Suggested jobs, menu bar](/assets/linkedin_jobs_home.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/

LinkedIn offers several paths for a user to take from this page. The most direct option - highlighted front and center - is to search jobs usng one of LinkedIn's quick suggestions.

Users can also choose from a variety of options on the left side to prepare for job hunting, scroll through LinkedIn's recommended jobs, or participate in recommended activities on the right.

I like that LinkedIn offers a variety of options and prep opportunities, but highlights actual jobs right away to let users begin their job search. Advertising for resume writers detracts from this - in my opinion, it should be to one side and not in the center.

#### Step 4 - Search For A Job
![LinkedIn Job Search Results](/assets/linkedin_job_search.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3457242351&keywords=entry%20level%20security%20engineer&refresh=true

Searching for a particular job displays results quickly and in an intuitive way. Filters are at the top, just below the search bar, jobs are listed on the left, and more detail for each job is listed on the right.

I like the way this site offers easy filtering, job lists, and more details taking up a large portion of the screen. One thing I dislike is how many of the jobs listed near the top are not entry level - this requires the user to do more work adding filters and scrolling through long lists of jobs to find applicable positions.

#### Step 5 - Refine Search
![LinkedIn Job Search Filter - Boxes Checked for Full-Time, Remote](/assets/linkedin_jobs_filter.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3457241546&keywords=entry%20level%20security%20engineer&refresh=true

Next, I used the filter feature to refine search criteria. This seemed intuitive and offered relevant filter options. It allows the user to search more quickly and therefore values the user's time.

One useful feature to add might be allowing users to save their filter options to be applied automatically in future job searches.

![LinkedIn Job Search Filter - Adding Filter for Experience Level](/assets/linkedin_jobs_filter2.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3517219677&f_JT=F&f_WT=2&keywords=entry%20level%20security%20engineer&refresh=true&sortBy=R

I needed to add an additional filter for experience level after searching based on the initial filter. This added step takes time and should have been included in the first set of filter options.

#### Step 6 - View Updated Results
![LinkedIn List of Filtered Jobs](/assets/linkedin_updated_jobs.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3351948625&f_E=2&f_JT=F&f_WT=2&keywords=entry%20level%20security%20engineer&refresh=true&sortBy=R

Again, this offers excellent detail and an intuitive list of jobs and filter options. There is a clear option for the user to apply to the listed job, and an additional option to save the job. This call to action is effectively placed.

The first job is not applicable to the search or my profile, but that may be due to relatively narrow search criteria. However, this is something that could be improved.

#### Step 7 - Apply for Job
![Home Depot - Job Application](/assets/linkedin_apply.png)

URL: https://careers.homedepot.com/job/17799163/cybersecurity-analyst-ii-remote-atlanta-ga/?utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=corporate&utm_medium=social_media&utm_content=job_posting&utm_term=ta_-jobwrap%2Fslots&ss=paid

Selecting the "Apply" button directs the user to the company's website to submit an application. This is a helpful way to direct the user to the place where they can continue the application process.

This page also has an orange, obvious button calling users to apply. It employs simple, intuitive headings and appears to be a user-friendly site.



| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2.5  | - Effective headings, navigation, etc. on most pages - easy to see where to go/what to do<br/><br/>-Some pages - such as feed page - busy/crowded; potentially distracting  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  2.5 | - Effective use of space, directions, filters, etc. to make searching for jobs faster<br/><br/>- Like all social media, endless streams of posts & job opportunities make it easy to waste time |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 | - Headings, menu options (Jobs, Network, Home, etc.), job filters, job info & application path all obvious and clear to user  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | - Steps clear: Login or create account buttons obvious, Jobs menu button obvious, search bar/filters for jobs obvious, Apply button obvious<br/><br/>-Tendency to strongly encourage user to be logged in (to collect data), consider upgrading, report to LinkedIn if applying for a job, and otherwise take actions to benefit LinkedIn  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2.5 | - In general concise<br/><br/>- Feed - too many words/options; potentially distracting from other tasks  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | - Navigation clear -Obvious login, menu bar, job search filters, and Apply button  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | - Based on LinkedIn's claims at https://www.linkedin.com/accessibility the site is accessible to screen readers. I was unable to test this without installing special extensions.<br/><br/>- I attempted to navigate the site using only a keyboard and found it fairly intuitive - elements were clearly in focus when I tabbed onto them, and pressing Enter allowed me to select those elements.  |
| **TOTAL** | 19.5  | - Overall, LinkedIn provides a good user experience for a job search   |

## 2.3 Site 2 - Handshake (not preferred)
Job Search Process with Screenshots & Steps:

*Note - I already have an account on this site and will be proceeding with the following steps under that assumption.

#### Step 1 - Log In
![Handshake Login through Messiah University](/assets/handshake_login.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/login

This login page is simple and intuitive - Handshake integrates with Messiah to allow students to sign in easily. The large blue button provides an obvious call to action, and other options include signing up for an account and downloading an app.

#### Step 2 - Home Page
![Handshake Home Page](/assets/handshake_home.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu

This page offers clear calls to action - attending an event and making your profile stand out - but is also fairly busy. Useful information is contained beneath the banner, covering most of the page, about reaching out to employers, but it is blocked by this banner and the popup about installing the app.

I would decrease the size of the banner so that potential jobs and other recommendations are visible, and also make sure the popup about installing the app does not block any content.

#### Step 3 - Jobs Home Page
![Handshake Jobs Home Page](/assets/handshake_jobs_home.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/postings

I clicked the "Jobs" menu option at the top left to reach this page. This seemed clear and intuitive.

Several positives about this page include that it offers a clear search bar and filters, lists jobs to the left in the normally accepted way, and includes more detail to the right. Additionally, it automatically searched for cybersecurity internships based on my profile.

There is a lack of contrast on this page that offers an area for improvement. Also, there is no direct call to action ("Apply" button) until you scroll farther down.

#### Step 4 - Adjusting Filters
![Handshake Jobs list with filters](/assets/handshake_jobs_filtered.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/postings?page=1&per_page=25&sort_direction=desc&sort_column=default&job.remote=true&job.job_types%5B%5D=9&job.job_types%5B%5D=3&employment_type_names%5B%5D=Full-Time

The offered filters are intuitive and clear. They are geared specifically toward college students, offering filters for things like distance to campus and willingness to interview on campus. This is particularly helpful for a college student and offers a benefit over a more generic tool like LinkedIn.

#### Step 5 - Apply
![Handshake Application Popup Window](/assets/handshake_apply.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/postings?page=1&per_page=25&sort_direction=desc&sort_column=default&job.remote=true&job.job_types%5B%5D=9&job.job_types%5B%5D=3&employment_type_names%5B%5D=Full-Time

This offers clear instructions on next steps, obvious buttons to continue the process, and uses simple and concise language.




| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  | - Offered clear headings, buttons, etc. as well as directions to next important task  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  |  - This site focused specifically on college students looking for internships/jobs, so it did not waste time on other things |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | - The home page was somewhat poorly designed - the large welcome banner hid important content lower down, and app installation popup obsucred some of the content<br/><br/>- Also, users need to scroll down to find the "Apply" button for a given job  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | - Yes, this site focuses on the job search and most of the headings/buttons are directed to leading users along this path   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |2.5   | - Effective at omitting words<br/><br/>- Login page busy compared to LinkedIn  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |2.5   |- The site's navigation via menu bars, buttons, search boxes, etc. was effective<br/><br/>- Potentially make "Apply" button visible without scrolling down  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  3 | - Again, based on Handshake's claims at https://support.joinhandshake.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049932314-Virtual-Accessibility-in-Handshake its website is accessible to screen readers and also supports keyboard-only use.<br/><br/>- I tested navigating the website using only the keyboard and found it fairly intuitive - I was able to navigate between and select page elements. Testing a screen reader would require installing a special extension.  |
| **TOTAL** | 19  | - Overall, Handshake also provides a good user experience for a job search, especially one geared toward colelge students  |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title |Visitor Accesses Exhibit Details Using QR Code|
| Description / Steps |1. User chooses exhibit (physically).<br/>2. User selects "Scan Code" option.<br/>3. QR code scan is initiated & completed.<br/>4. A new page is displayed with exhibit-specific content associated with that QR code.<br/>5. The app logs that this user has viewed the content for this exhibit. |
| Primary Actor |Visitor to Oakes Museum |
| Preconditions |1. User is logged into the app.<br/>2. User is on tour home page.<br/>3. User has given app camera permissions. |
| Postconditions |1. Exhibit-specific content is displayed.<br/>2. App registers that user has visited that exhibit - marked as complete on list of all exhibits. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product
Use Case: Visitor accesses exhibit-specific information by scanning a QR code on/near the exhibit.

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 -  [PocketSights](https://pocketsights.com/) (Used for test)
2. Competitor 2 - [visiTour](https://www.studentbridge.com/visitour/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Starting on home page of PocketSights website - Navigate to a tour given a specific title ("Pella's Gorgeous Gardens").   | Normally this would be done on a GPS-enabled phone while physically on site, but this offers a usability test of the Web version for remote users.  |
| 2 | Navigate to information about Brinkhoff Park.  | This is a stop about three-quarters way through the tour and simulates a user looking for information about a specific site.  |
| 3 | Locate Brinkhoff Park on the in-site map.  | This requires users to go back a page and locate the map, which may potentially be a point of frustration.  |
| 4 | Read more about the ninth stop on the tour.  | This can be done in multiple ways - selecting the point on the map, scrolling down to the ninth step, or clicking a link for another page dedicated to only that site.  |
| 5 | Determine what organization created this tour.  |The organization - Visit Pella - is listed at the top in small font.   |
| 6 |Navigate to the place where comments on this tour would be displayed.  | The tour does not actually have any comments, but finding the place where they are located is intuitive.  |
| 7 | Change to a satellite view and zoom in on tour stop 10.  | This is a fairly intuitive use of the map.  |
| 8 | Using the map, determine whether tour stops 1 and 2 are within walking distance of each other.  | They are.  |
| 9 | Navigate to a page with information specific to tour stop 1 through the map.  | It is possibly not completely obvious that you can do this through the map rather than scrolling down and picking a link.  |
| 10 | Determine where this tour is (city and state). | The tour is in Pella, Iowa.  |
| 11 | Visit what you feel is the most interesting or engaging part of the site.  | This may give feedback for what parts of our project we should focus on most. |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Starting on home page of PocketSights website - Navigate to a tour given a specific title ("Pella's Gorgeous Gardens").   |  |
| 2 | Navigate to information about Brinkhoff Park.  |   |
| 3 | Locate Brinkhoff Park on the in-site map.  |   |
| 4 | Read more about the ninth stop on the tour.  |   |
| 5 | Determine what organization created this tour.  |   |
| 6 |Navigate to the place where comments on this tour would be displayed.  |   |
| 7 | Change to a satellite view and zoom in on tour stop 10.  |  |
| 8 | Using the map, determine whether tour stops 1 and 2 are within walking distance of each other.  |  |
| 9 | Navigate to a page with information specific to tour stop 1 through the map.  | .  |
| 10 | Determine where this tour is (city and state). | |
| 11 | Visit what you feel is the most interesting or engaging part of the site.  | |

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
Pithy usability rule:

Users are extraterrestrials.

Designers should carefully consider assumptions they make about the way users think. Just like many sci-fi books and movies explore sapient life that thinks in completely different ways from us - undermining many of our own assumptions - designers should assume that users cannot be relied upon to see the "obvious" path or make a natural leap in logic the way that the developers do. Conclusions about users should be based on data gathered during usability tests or in other ways, not based on designers assuming that users will think like them. It is impossible to avoid generalizations, but the average user may think and navigate a website in a completely different way from how the designer would do it.
